# Tabuh: a tool for parents to talk about sexuality with their kids
# What is this project about? #
Building an on-line platform for school parents who would like to support/accompany the sexual education of their kid.
# TOPIC #
Sexual education is part of the elementary school curriculum and kids starting the age of 8 or 9 receive their first lessons. The pre-adolescence is a critical moment, given that as of this age, girls and boys' bodies start to develop the first changes that will lead to puberty. 
Even if a lot has changed in the past decades, where neither school or parents would discuss sexuality with children and youngsters, this topic remains quite tabu in the public domain. Despite and inspite all the information available on the internet, sexual education is not present in the classic communication channels, such as television, radio or press. The proliferation of pornography genre has invaded the internet and is becoming a default go-to source for many boys and adults. This is becoming a problem for those who take porno films as a normal sexual conduct and expect men and women to behave alike.
In my view, there is a lack of open communication between parents and kids. That is why I would like to help parents not shy away from this topic and help them be ready for having conversations with their children about puberty, menstruation, reproduction, feelings, relationship, gender, etc. 

For that I envisage developing an online platform called TABUH to help school parent’s find informal ways to approach such topics and encourage them to exchange views and experiences. TABUH should be accessible only to the parents of the class and be a simple and intuitive tool to present tips and ideas on how to talk about sexuality. 
The security aspect is important, so that parents can feel free to add information they would like to share with the other parents. This tool should not be in connection with other social networks. 
The topics to be discussed in TABUH should mirror the structure of those taught in the school.

# IMPACT #
This platform could be used at first amongst parents of the same class, but later it could be replicated to other classes or the whole school.  
The basis for it would be that it is a voluntary and a free to use platform. People should understand who enters the information, so that there is transparency on who says what. It would require to be set-up by a volunteer that can act as a moderator.
Unlike Facebook or other social media, this is not intended to provide a shop window image of the users. This is rather a private place where to safely interact digitally with the members of a community you belong to, in this case the 3rd elementary class of my daughter. 
Moreover, by sharing ways to approach a common issue - how to talk about sexuality to my kid?-  people will appreciate the openness and possibly be able to build stronger relationships during the in-person occasions. 
# How it will be implemented?
Space: 
  The parent’s community of the 3rd elementary class in the Liebfrauenschule in Frankfurt. An on-line platform would be the virtual space for this project.
People 
  The class is made of 24 kids, so that there would be 48 parents in total. Amongst those there are two parents that act as representatives of the parents. The project could be presented to the main teachers and the school.
Resources
  Myself and possibly this could start with the mothers side of the class..
Time 
  This is in the space of the next half a year, potentially one and a half year (until the end of my daughter’s elementary school).
Technology
  I would like to explore the use of MIRO ot Discord platform or similar.
